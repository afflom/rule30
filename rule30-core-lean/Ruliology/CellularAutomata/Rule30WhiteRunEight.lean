# Rule 30: the words `0^r 1 1` with `r ≥ 8`

`Rule30BlackRuns.no_white_run_11` excludes the repeating words `0^r 1 1` with `r ≥ 10`. The same
lemmas give the exclusion for every `r ≥ 8`:

* `no_white_run_11_ge8`: the center column is not eventually periodic with repeating word
  `0^r 1 1`, `r ≥ 8`, whatever the transient.

**Proof.** Column `1` is tracked at the starts of the periods. The `r ≥ 10` proof shows that it
turns black within two periods, outside one exceptional case, and stays black; that uses
`period_lock` at depths up to `r - 8`. Here two classes of period starts are tracked instead:
"column `1` black", which is absorbing (`period_lock` at depth `0`, which needs `r ≥ 8`), and
"column `1` white, column `2` black". A first black cell at depth `≤ r + 1` leads into one of them
in the next period (`period_late`), and depths `r + 2`, `r + 4` and beyond lead into one of them
within two periods (`period_z1`, `period_z3`, `period_z4`). If the remaining case, a first black
cell at depth `r + 3`, holds at every period start, column `1` reads `0^(r+1) 1` in every period
(`period_z2`). Otherwise the period starts eventually stay in the two classes, and column `1`
eventually reads `1^(r+1) 0` or `0 1^r 0` in every period. In each case column `1` is eventually
periodic, and so is column `0`, against Jen's theorem (`Rule30Jen.not_adjacent`).
