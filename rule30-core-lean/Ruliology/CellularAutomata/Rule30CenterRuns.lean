# Runs of the center column are at most linear in time, so both colors recur geometrically

**Partial result.** For the center column `c t = Rule30Prize.center t` of rule 30 from a single
black cell. A *run of length `L` starting at time `a`* is any block of `L` consecutive cells
`c a, …, c (a + L - 1)` of one color, stated as `∀ i, i < L → center (a + i) = b`. It does not have
to be maximal: `c (a - 1)` is unconstrained.

* **Black runs.** A black run that starts at time `a ≥ 1` has length at most `a` (`black_run_le`).
  The bound is attained at `a = 3` (`c 3 = c 4 = c 5 = 1`).
* **White runs.** A white run that starts at time `a ≥ 1` has length at most `a - 1`
  (`white_run_le'`), and for `a ≥ 3` at most `a - 3` (`white_run_le_three`). With truncated
  subtraction, `a = 1` says `c 1 = 1`. The bound `a - 1` is attained only at `a = 2` (`c 2 = 0`);
  `a - 3` is not attained up to time 3000, where the closest case is `a = 6` (`c 6 = c 7 = 0`,
  length `2 = a - 4`).
* **Recurrence.** Every window `[a, 2a]` holds a white cell (`exists_white`). Every window `[a, 2a)`
  holds a black cell (`exists_black'`), and so does `[a, 2a - 2)` for `a ≥ 3`
  (`exists_black_three`).
* **Counts.** Before time `2^m` there are at least `m + 1` black cells (`blackCount_pow_two`), so
  `Nat.log2 n + 1 ≤ blackCount n` for `n ≥ 1` (`log_two_succ_le_blackCount`) and
  `Nat.log2 n ≤ blackCount n` (`log_two_le_blackCount`). Before time `4^m` there are at least `m`
  white cells (`whiteCount_pow_four`), so `Nat.log2 n / 2 ≤ whiteCount n` (`log_le_whiteCount`);
  `Nat.log2 n / 2` is `⌊log₄ n⌋`. The catalog has no `Nat.log`, so the logarithms are core's
  `Nat.log2`.
* **Every configuration with a leftmost black cell.** The black bound holds for every column `i`
  of every configuration whose leftmost black cell is at `lo`, measured from the time the left edge
  passed the column: a black run of column `i` from time `a ≥ 1` (with `lo - i < a`) has length at
  most `a + i - lo` (`black_run_le_evol`).

`Rule30BlackRuns` excludes long black runs from an eventually periodic center column; the bounds
here hold at every time, with no periodicity assumed. They use the left-edge diagonals `D` of
`Rule30Diagonals` (`D 0 = D 1 = 1` from time 1) and the white-run lemmas of `Rule30BlackRuns`
(`first_black`, `front_moves`, `black_stays`). Numerically the longest runs are far shorter, about
logarithmic in the time: up to time 10^6 the longest white run is 19 and the longest black run 22.

**The argument.**

*Black runs.* While the center is black, `c (t + 1) = ¬ cell t (-1)`, since `rule l 1 r = ¬ l`.
Left-permutivity (`Rule30Jen.cell_left`) pushes the pattern outward: at the start `a` of a black
run of length `L`, the row reads `… 0 1 0 1` over the `L` cells ending at the center
(`black_triangle`). The row's two leftmost black cells, at `-a` and `-a + 1`, are adjacent
(`cell_left_edge`, `D_one`), so the alternating block cannot cover them: `L ≤ a`.

*White runs.* During a white run the first black cell right of the center, at column `ℓ + 1`, moves
left one column per step (`front_moves`); once in column `1` it stays there (`black_stays`). So
column `1` is white before time `a + ℓ` and black from then on, whether or not the front arrives
during the run (`col_one`). Left-permutivity then determines the whole row left of the center
inside the run's light cone through one closed form, `preRow k (a + ℓ - t)` (`pre_triangle`). At
time `a` the row reads `0^(ℓ+1) 1` and then alternates (`row_at_start`). The left-edge diagonals
are rigid: `D 2 = 0`, `D 3 = [t odd]` and `D 4 = 1` from time 2 (`D_two`, `D_three`, `D_four`). The
forced row cannot match `D 1`, …, `D 4` once the run reaches column `-(a - 4)`, which gives
`L ≤ a - 3`, and `L ≤ a - 1` for every `a ≥ 1`.

*Every configuration.* `black_triangle_evol` is `black_triangle` for any column of any evolution
(`Rule30FiniteConfigs.evol_left`), and `evol_left_edge_succ` says the two leftmost black cells
are adjacent at every time `t ≥ 1`.

**Not claimed.** Nothing sublinear: runs of length about `log a` are what the data show, and a
bound like `a / 2` would need a speed bound on the left edge of the chaotic region. This is a
partial result, not a solution of Problem 1.

/-! ### White runs: the row is forced already at the start of the run

During a white run starting at time `a`, let the first black cell right of the center be at column
`ℓ + 1`. Column `1` is white before time `a + ℓ` and black from then on (`col_one`), so
left-permutivity determines the row left of the center at every time `t` of the run, through a
closed form `preRow k (a + ℓ - t)` (`pre_triangle`). At time `a` the row reads `0^(ℓ+1) 1` and then
alternates; it cannot agree with the left-edge diagonals `D 1 = 1`, `D 2 = 0`, `D 3 = [a odd]`,
`D 4 = 1` if the run reaches column `-(a - 1)`. -/
