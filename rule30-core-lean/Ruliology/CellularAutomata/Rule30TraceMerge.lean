# A limitation of reconstructing the left half from one center trace

Two explicit configurations with left edge -3 have the same entire center
trace but different initial cells at -1. Their right halves are periodic and
infinite. Their complete rows merge after one step and become finite after
two steps. Thus eventual finiteness cannot replace finiteness at time zero
in a proposed stronger left-reconstruction argument.

This is NOT a counterexample to EdgeObservable: the left edges agree. It is
also NOT a counterexample involving two finite initial configurations.
No full prize problem is claimed solved.
