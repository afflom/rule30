# Rule 30, period 2: the coupled question in finite configurations and sideways

`Rule30PeriodTwoCoupled.CQ01` is the open statement that excludes an eventual period `2`. This
module restates it in two ways, locates the one candidate counterexample for each right half, and
proves the barrier that goes with them.

**Finite configurations.**
* `CQ01_iff_no_finite_alternating`: `CQ01` holds exactly when no configuration with finitely many
  black cells has center column `1, 0, 1, 0, …` from time `0`: it is the period-2 case of the
  finite-configuration version of Problem 1.
* `Q01_no_leftfinite_alternating`: `Q01` already covers every configuration whose left half is
  finite, whatever its right half.

**Sideways.** For a right half `R`, `u R s` is column `1` at the white step `2 s + 1` of the right
half driven by the alternating column.
* `Psi R`: the left row that keeps the center alternating forever against `R`. It is the
  constrained start `Theta` whose free bits are the complement of `u R` (`Psi_inX`, `Psi_free`).
  `Psi_unique`: every left row that does so agrees with `Psi R` at every depth `≥ 1`.
* `CQ01_iff_Psi`: `CQ01` says that `Psi R` has infinitely many black cells for every finitely
  supported `R`.
* `not_finSupp_Psi_of_eventuallyPeriodic` (the absorption route): this holds whenever `u R` is
  eventually periodic.
* `not_finSupp_Psi_of_R2`: it holds for `R` whenever it holds for `R2 R`, the right half two steps
  later.

**Exact death.** A left row `L` keeps the center alternating exactly until the first depth `d ≥ 1`
where it differs from `Psi R`.
* `exact_death`: column `-1` of the run from `L` meets the coupled constraint (`Meets`) at every
  time `t < d - 1` and violates it at time `d - 1`. This is left-permutivity
  (`Rule30ZeroBoundary.pivot`).
* `alternates_iff_meets`: in the configuration `glue L R` (left row `L`, black center, right half
  `R`), the center alternates through time `n` exactly when `L` meets the constraint at every time
  `t < n`. `exact_death_center`: the center alternates through time `d - 1` and not at time `d`.
* `truncation_death`: the truncation of `Psi R` at width `W` keeps the center alternating exactly
  until the first black depth of `Psi R` beyond `W`.
So for each `R` the row `Psi R` is the only candidate counterexample to `CQ01`.

**The `R = ∅` milestone.** `CQ01Empty` (**open**): `Psi empty` has infinitely many black cells.
`CQ01Empty_of_CQ01`. `CQ01Empty_iff`: no finite configuration whose right half (positions `≥ 1`) is
white keeps the center alternating from time `0`.

**Barrier.** `alternates_long`: from finite configurations the center can alternate for any number
of steps (the cut ether `Rule30ZeroBoundaryBarriers.c7cut`). So
`no_finite_abstract_ranking_coupled`: no ranking through a finite abstraction of configurations
decreases at every double step over which the center flips twice. This is the two-sided form of
barrier B1 (`Rule30ZeroBoundaryBarriers.no_finite_abstract_ranking`).

The exact-death identity was first observed numerically, for `R = ∅` and widths up to `300`.
