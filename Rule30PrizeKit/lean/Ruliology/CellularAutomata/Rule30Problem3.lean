# Prize Problem 3: the effort of computing the center column

    Problem 3: Does computing the nth cell of the center column require at least O(n)
               computational effort?

Effort needs a model of computation. The reference model here is a deterministic one-tape Turing
machine, with finitely many states and tape symbols, that reads the binary digits of `n`, least
significant first, and halts with the answer. Its effort is its number of steps. Three versions of
the problem, each implying the next:

* `Problem3`, the formal statement published with the prize: no machine computes `center n` within
  `C · (n + 1)` steps, for any constant `C`; that is, no machine whose time divided by `n` has a
  finite limit superior.
* `Problem3Verbal`, the question's "at least O(n)": no machine computes it in time `o(n)`.
* `Problem3Robust`: no machine computes it in time `n^o(1)`, that is within `n^ε` steps from some
  `n` on, for every `ε > 0`. This version does not depend on the model.

**Why only the last one is model independent.** The reasonable sequential models simulate one
another with polynomial overhead: Turing machines with any number of tapes, random-access machines
that pay for the length of the numbers they handle, and input in any base `b ≥ 2`, in either digit
order. A polynomial overhead multiplies exponents by constants, so whether some positive power
`n^ε` is needed is the same in all of them. A bound of `n` itself is not:
* a one-tape machine simulates several tapes in quadratic time, so a lower bound of `n` steps on
  one tape gives only `√n` on several;
* a random-access machine that does bitwise operations on unbounded integers at unit cost computes
  `c(n)` in `O(n)` operations, as bit `n` of `Fⁿ(1)` with `F(x) = x XOR (2x OR 4x)`.

Unary input is a different problem. It is exponentially longer, and on it every machine needs more
than `n` steps, because the center column is not eventually constant.

* `Machine`, `Machine.run`: the machine and its run on the input `n`.
* `Computes M f T`: on every input `n`, `M` halts within `T n` steps with the answer `f n`.
* `problem3Verbal_of_problem3`, `problem3Robust_of_problem3Verbal`: the chain of implications.
* `computes_lowBit`: a machine that answers with the last binary digit in one step, as a check of
  the conventions.
