# Forbidden suffixes give white-padding exclusions with arbitrary prefixes

If a finite driver word cannot send any width-K strip to the all-white strip,
then it cannot be the suffix of a sufficiently white-padded eventual period.
The part of the tail preceding that suffix is arbitrary and has unbounded length.
This strengthens the vacuum-avoidance interface: no stabilized reachable set is
needed, and a single certificate works for infinitely many different tails.

The analytic white-pulse estimate remains essential. These results do not exclude
every periodic word, in particular the alternating period is still open.
