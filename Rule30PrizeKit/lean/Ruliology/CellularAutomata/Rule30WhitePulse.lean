# A shield survives every short pulse

A black run in the first right column creates a striped block. An interior black
cell of that block survives an arbitrary boundary pulse of length m by locality.
These lemmas quantify the absorbing, synchronized regime without enumerating tails.
They do not prove every periodic history enters that regime.
