# A spacing-three/five gate with seventeen white initial cells

The gate is globally periodic of period 31, with gaps 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5.
Its reconstructed initial row is white at depths 528 through 544. A finite
packed cone is proved equal to the kit's scalar reconstruction. There is no
claim that this gate is realized by a finite driven right half.
