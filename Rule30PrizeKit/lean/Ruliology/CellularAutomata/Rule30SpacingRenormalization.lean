# An eight-column reconstruction identity and the condition needed to iterate it

The boundary history is `!G 0, 1, !G 1, 1, ...`. If the black gate
positions have spacing at least three, shifting reconstruction eight columns
left replaces `G r` by `G (r+2) xor G (r+4)`. This condition is not asserted
to hold after that replacement, or for every driven right half.
