# Rule 30, least period 3: the ether erodes, so there is no wall of any width

**Partial result.** Setting of `Rule30EtherThree`: `F` is a rule-30 evolution of the columns
`p ≥ 1` (`IsR30 F`) whose column `0` is ether column `j0` with phase offset `s` from time `t1` on.
The ether value of column `p` at time `t` is `ether3 (j0 + p) (t + s)`.

* `erosion3_fin`: if at time `t1` the columns `1..k` carry the ether, the columns beyond `k + w`
  carry the ether, and some column does not, then at some time `t ≤ t1 + 3 w + 6` one of the
  columns `1..k` differs from the ether. A finite perturbation always eats into the ether, at
  average speed at least `2/5` once it is in its wake.
* `no_wall`: for every attachment column `a` and every width `b ≥ 1`, a predicate `W` with
  `WallOK a b W` is empty. This extends the kernel certificate `no_wall_le_12`
  (`Rule30EtherThreeNoWall`) from widths `≤ 12` to all widths. So the period-3 ether-and-wall
  family of `Rule30EtherThree` is empty, and `absorption3_excludes` is vacuous for every wall:
  the ether-and-wall route to least period 3 is closed. The open statements for least period 3
  (`AbsorptionT t001`, `Q001`, `C3s001`, `C3w(011)`) do not involve walls and remain open.

**The argument.** Let the *front* `D` be the leftmost column that differs from the ether
(`Front`). Its *state* is the class of column `D`, `(j0 + D + 4 (t + s)) mod 12` (`cls`), together
with whether column `D + 1` is also a defect (`ubit`): 24 states. Columns `D - 2, D - 1` are ether,
so the next front and its state depend only on the class and on the columns `D + 1 .. D + 4`.
A kernel check over these 576 local patterns (`cert_all`) shows:

* exactly one state, `B = (class 10, D + 1 defective)`, can send the front three or more columns to
  the right in one step; every other next front lies in `D - 1 .. D + 2` and is not `B`;
* from `B` the front either moves by exactly `+2` into a good state, or jumps right by `≥ 3`;
  if it lands in `B` again, the class equation forces a jump of at least `8`;
* a potential `ψ ∈ [0, 10]` on the 23 good states (`psiTab`) satisfies
  `5 ΔD + 2 + ψ(new) ≤ ψ(old)` on every step from a good state.

`front_step` turns this into a statement about `F` (for `D ≥ 2`; column `0` is forced, not
computed). Hence the good states are closed and `5 D + 2 t + ψ` does not increase (`wake_good`):
the front moves left at average speed at least `2/5`. For a finite perturbation the rightmost
defect `R` moves right by exactly one column per step (`redge_step`: rule 30 is permutive in its
left input) and `D ≤ R`. A `B → B` step gains `≥ 8` on `R`'s `1`, so the initial run of `B` steps
is shorter than `(R - D) / 7 + 1 ≤ (w - 1) / 7 + 1` (`run_bad`); after it the front is good and at
most `w + n + 1` columns right of `k`, and the potential brings it to `≤ k` in time. The arithmetic
gives `3 w + 6`.

For `no_wall`: from a wall state at phase `< 3`, put the ether on columns `1..k`
(`k ≡ a mod 12`), the strip on `k + 1 .. k + b`, a flipped cell at `k + b + 1` and the ether beyond
(`wallCfg`), and drive column `0` with the ether (`Rule30Ether.drv`). `trap_invariant3` keeps
columns `1..k` ether forever, and `erosion3_fin` (with `w = b + 1`) breaks them.

The certificate and the potential come from an exhaustive computation (two independent code
paths); here they are checked by the kernel (`decide +kernel`, about two seconds).

/-! ### (c) Erosion of a finite perturbation -/

/-- **Erosion3-fin.** Let `F` be a rule-30 evolution of the columns `p ≥ 1` whose column `0` is
ether column `j0` (phase offset `s`) from time `t1` on. If at time `t1` the columns `1..k` carry the
ether, the columns beyond `k + w` carry the ether, and some column does not, then within `3 w + 6`
steps one of the columns `1..k` leaves the ether. -/
