# The words `0^r 1 1`, `r ≥ 8`, for every finite configuration

`Rule30WhiteRunEight` shows that the center column of the single black cell is not eventually
`0^r 1 1` repeated, for `r ≥ 8`. The proof follows column `1` at the starts of the periods, through
the first black cell right of the center; the seed has one at every time because of its right
edge. Here the same argument runs for column `0` of the evolution of any configuration `x` with a
leftmost black cell (for Jen's theorem), given a black cell right of column `0` from some time on.
Translation then gives every column of every nonzero finite configuration, whose rightmost black
cell moves one cell right per step.

* `front_moves`, `period_lock`, `period_late`, `period_far`, `period_z1`, …, `period_z4`,
  `periodic_blocks`, `first_black`: the lemmas of `Rule30BlackRuns`, for column `0` of any
  evolution.
* `no_white_run_11_col0`: column `0` of `evol x` is not eventually `0^r 1 1` repeated (`r ≥ 8`),
  whatever the transient, for every `x` with a leftmost black cell and a black cell right of
  column `0` from some time on.
* `evol_right_edge`, `exists_rightmost`: the right edge of a configuration that is white right of
  some black cell, and the rightmost black cell of a nonzero finite configuration.
* `no_white_run_11_finite`: **every column of every nonzero finite configuration**: no column is
  eventually `0^r 1 1` repeated, for `r ≥ 8`.
