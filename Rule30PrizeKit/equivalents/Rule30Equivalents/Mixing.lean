# Rule 30 preserves the fair-coin measure and is mixing

Rule 30 as a measure-preserving dynamical system on
`{0,1}^ℤ` with the fair-coin measure `coins ℤ`. Everything comes from left-permutivity: flipping
the coin at the foot `a - t` of the cell `(t, a)` flips that cell (`Genericity.evol_flip_at`),
preserves the measure, and changes no cell whose foot lies to its right.

* `measure_inter_cells`, `measure_cells`: **cells with distinct feet are independent fair coins**.
  The foot of the cell `(t, i)` is `i - t`, the leftmost coin of its light cone. Finitely many cells
  with pairwise distinct feet take each pattern with probability `2^-|S|`: adding them from the
  leftmost foot, each one halves the measure (`RandomConfigurations.two_mul_measure_flip`).
* `measure_inter_window`: if an event `A` does not depend on the coins left of `m`, and
  `i - t < m` for every `i ∈ I`, then the window `I` of the `t`-th image is uniform and independent
  of `A`.
* `measurePreserving_evol`: every iterate of rule 30 preserves `coins ℤ` (Hedlund's theorem for
  rule 30).
* `measure_window_inter_window`: the window `J` of a configuration and the window `I` of its
  `t`-th image are independent once `t > max I - min J`. So rule 30 is topologically mixing
  (`exists_mem_evol_mem`).
* `tendsto_measure_inter_preimage`: **rule 30 is mixing**, `μ(A ∩ F^{-t} B) → μ(A) μ(B)` for all
  measurable `A` and `B`: for cylinders the two sides agree once `t` exceeds the distance between
  their windows (`measure_inter_preimage_cylinder`), and every measurable set is close to a
  cylinder (`exists_cylinder_approx`, from Mathlib's approximation by a generating ring of sets).
  Hence `ergodic_evol_one`: rule 30 is ergodic, in Mathlib's sense of `Ergodic`.
* `tendsto_birkhoffAverage_integral`: **the L² ergodic theorem for rule 30** (von Neumann, through
  Mathlib's `ContinuousLinearMap.tendsto_birkhoffAverage_orthogonalProjection` for the Koopman
  operator `koopman`): for every `g ∈ L²` the averages `(g + g ∘ F + ⋯ + g ∘ F^(N-1)) / N`
  converge in `L²` to the constant `∫ g`; the limit is invariant, hence constant by ergodicity.
* `ae_existsUnique_preimage`, `residual_existsUnique_preimage`: **rule 30 is invertible almost
  everywhere and generically**: almost every configuration, and a comeager set of them, show `010`
  arbitrarily far to the right and so have exactly one preimage
  (`Preimages.eq_of_evol_one_eq_of_frequently`). Hence rule 30 is injective on a set of full
  measure (`exists_injOn_ae`), though not injective (`Preimages.exists_ne_left_eq`), and every
  row of the space-time diagram of almost every configuration determines it
  (`ae_injective_iterate`).
* `mixing_all_orders`: **rule 30 is mixing of all orders**: cylinders at times whose gaps exceed
  the width of their windows are independent (`measure_biInter_preimage_cylinder`), so
  `μ(F^{-t₀} A₀ ∩ ⋯ ∩ F^{-tₙ₋₁} Aₙ₋₁) → μ(A₀) ⋯ μ(Aₙ₋₁)` as the gaps between the times grow.
* `ae_frequently_mem`, `residual_frequently_mem`: for almost every configuration, and for a
  comeager set of configurations, the orbit enters every nonempty open set at arbitrarily large
  times, so its omega-limit set is all of `{0,1}^ℤ` (by ergodicity, and by topological mixing and
  Baire).
* `ae_rightHalves_frequently`: for almost every configuration, every pattern appears at the cells
  `0, …, N - 1` at arbitrarily late times, so every sequence is a limit point of the right halves of
  the rows (for the seed, Kopra's theorem gives infinitely many limit points).
* `evol_flip_front`, `sensitive`: the right front of a perturbation moves at speed one, and rule 30
  is sensitive to initial conditions.
* `log_two_le_coverEntropy`: **rule 30 has topological entropy at least `log 2`** (Mathlib's
  `coverEntropy`): the center trace is a uniformly continuous factor map onto the full shift on
  `{0,1}^ℕ`, whose entropy is at least `log 2` (`log_two_le_coverEntropy_shift`). And
  `coverEntropy_le_log_three`: **at most `log 3`**. Every entourage contains agreement on a window
  `[-N, N]` (`exists_windowRel_subset`). By left permutivity the columns `N, N + 1` over
  `n + 2N + 1` steps determine the window for `n` steps (`RightHalfReturns.eq_left_of_eq_columns`),
  and their words obey a local rule: a black cell in column `N + 1` is followed by the complement
  of its left neighbor, since `u ⊕ (1 ∨ w) = ¬u` (`compat_evol_one`). So each word extends backward
  in time by at most three of the four letters, at most `4 · 3^L` words of length `L + 1` occur
  (`card_pairWords_le`), and they cover `n` steps (`coverMincard_le`). The light-cone count gives
  only `2 log 2`.
* `measurePreserving_cells`: a sequence of cells with pairwise distinct feet is a fair-coin
  sequence. Along any path that never moves right, `p (t + 1) ≤ p t`, the feet decrease
  (`measurePreserving_path`, `ae_isNormal_path`); columns are the constant paths
  (`ae_isNormal_columns`), and the left edge of the light cone is `p t = -t`.
* `measurePreserving_line`, `ae_isNormal_lines`: **every line of velocity other than `1` is a
  fair-coin sequence**: the cells `(qk + t₀, pk + x₀)` have distinct feet `(p - q) k + x₀ - t₀`
  when `p ≠ q`, whatever the sign and size of the velocity `p/q`. So for almost every configuration
  the cells along every such line, through every cell, form a normal sequence, and no line inside
  the light cone is eventually periodic (`ae_every_line`, the hypothesis of
  `StrongerStatements.problem1_of_every_line`). Velocity `1` is the exception: along a right
  diagonal, `(t, a)` and `(t + 1, a + 1)` agree with probability `1/4` (`measure_diag_eq`).
* `ae_isNormal_rows`: for almost every configuration the right half of every row is normal (every
  iterate preserves the measure).
